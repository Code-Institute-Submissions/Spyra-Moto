## CLIEN / OWNER



To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.





In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.
