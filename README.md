## UX (User Experience)

### Project Goals

      time establish good conversion rate (unsettled / unknown yet for this kind of niche market and not having this sort of data from past),
    * Motivate an audience to take next step (call, text, e-mail or submit a web inquiry). Designed pages and implemented features should serving 
      to that goal by many marketing and decision-making ways.

* Gain trust.
    * Delivering history of company confirmed in timeline on social media,

    * Releasing teaser about research and tests of new materials to be introduced in near future, 
    * Providing open-minded approach to external, unlisted models or requested extra shaped / custom-tailored projects.


 

### Targeting

* Who is the focus of the goal? 
    * a biker who wants to tuning their machine in significant way by adding hand crafted exhaust,
    * a friend or close person (or group) who knows one interest and want to buy a gift / surprise,
    * motorcycle owner, enthusiast of bold design.

* Why users buy a product? 
    * to feel satisfaction while driving,
    * to be noticed by other road users,
    * to make impression in visited places by look and sound,
    * to be recognizable differnet among all riders on the same bike model, 
    * to share their proud with social media,
    * to make a gift for someone else,
    * to reach for a Bucket List item.


* What they're worried about? 
    * high prices, 
    * hidden fees, 
    * long time of product delivered, 
    * fake company (scam), 
    * unskilled welder (bungler),
    * poor materials / quality, 
    * bad look of product (aesthetics). 
    

* How to help them? 
    * clear straight prices, 
    * walk through order to delivery process
    * assurance of delivery fee included (where possible - currently Europe), 
    * gain trust by proving buyers good experience and social media reputation, pictures of products and from buyerrs feedback.

and positive feedback from actual customers and fanpage visitors.

has been incorporated now into webpage to build strong image of “entrepreneur you can rely”. Pictures bringing closer to <br>
product and enthusiastic comments can assure new visitors about how stable this company is.
<br><br>
There’s more behind this project – client motivated by creating process of the website ordered new line of `logo` from States, <br>
that led to creating cool picture in terms of overall marketing and public relations.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Buy now
- Filter: display all products for same bike model
- Embedded Google Maps with Buyers town location (respect to GDPR)

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

<!-- Popper.js and jQuerry - both as part of Boootstrap -->

Photoshop?
Bootstrap
Font Awesome


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

<!-- Tested: links (correct destination, blank or not etc), hovers, responsiveness -->

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

 <!-- ALL ABOVE TO BE EDITED!  -->

`FRESH NOTES FOR LATER:`

* The goal is to motivate an audience to take next step (call, text, e-mail or submit a web inquiry). Pages and features implemented are serving to that goal by many ways.

* More customers - who are these customers? How many more of them is needed? What exactly is expected of customers (BUY in first place, FOLLOW social media helping spread of the brand among friends)

* 

* Goal is measureable via number of requests send to owner via social media and available contact details such as phone, whatsup or e-mail

* Perfect customer: visits webbsite, sends enquire to oreder pipes it's once-off, pretty rare that same customer will buy another pipes over the time. Next he could share his pretty pipes around all friends getting them jealous but interested.

* Whats working? What's not working? What could be better?

## VALUES

<br>
<br>



### FOR USER / VISITOR

The user has access to the gallery, gets offers, sees range of products and has possibility to ask for price or any additional <br>
questions through form or using contact details. Here highlighted WhatsApp feature informs that unwelcomed international <br>
call/text costs can be avoided, handy especially to ease contact for overseas buyers (company has a global range of consumers).
<br><br>
Visitor can recognise credibility of company, an essential verification based on insight into company social media profiles. <br>
That allows to assess owner’s timeline, check quality of followers, number of comments and likes. In times of scam websites <br>
and fake sellers it is appreciated “tool” for customer. Meanwhile it works perfectly for the owner to attract visitor to become <br>
a follower or further - earn a buyer.
<br><br>
Contact form delivers simple communication channel to ask whatever they like.
<br><br>
<br>
### HUMBLE ME

This project delivers values for both client and users. And for me, so it’s win-win-win

This was great opportunity to create content, set and consult PR line, invent and test some marketing tools and combine all <br>
that with good design.
