## Welcome to my README!
--------

Project has been created as the official website of a small but real company from metallurgy sector, that ran only social <br>
media accounts until now but grew up to stage where own www is a must-have for proper interactions with customers.
<br>
<br>

# VALUE

This project delivers values for both client and users. And for me, so it’s win-win-win! 
<br>
<br>

## CLIENT / OWNER

The client has opportunity to display products in the Web, advertise extras, attract by highlighting offers to making order, <br>
prove experience as successful entrepreneur for number of years and show his technical skills through pictures of products <br>
and positive feedback from actual customers and fanpage visitors.
<br><br>
Heritage and trust gained by couple of years posting on healthy accounts Facebook and Instagram with no-fake-followers <br>
has been incorporated now into webpage to build strong image of “entrepreneur you can rely”. Pictures bringing closer to <br>
product and enthusiastic comments can assure visitors about how stable this company is.
<br><br>
There’s more behind this project – client motivated by creating process of website ordered new line of `logo` from States, <br>
that led to creating cool picture in terms of marketing and public relations. 
<br><br>
<br>
## USER / VISITOR

The user has access to the gallery, gets offers, sees range of products and has possibility to ask for price or any additional <br>
questions through form or using contact details. Here highlighted WhatsApp feature informs that unwelcomed international <br>
call/text costs can be avoided, handy especially to ease contact for overseas buyers (company has a global range of consumers).
<br><br>
Visitor can recognise credibility of company, an essential verification based on insight into company social media profiles. <br>
That allows to assess owner’s timeline, check quality of followers, number of comments and likes. In times of scam websites <br>
and fake sellers it is appreciated “tool” for customer. Meanwhile it works perfectly for the owner to attract visitor to become <br>
a follower or further - earn a buyer.
<br><br>
Contact form delivers simple communication channel to ask whatever they like.
<br><br>
<br>
## HUMBLE ME

This was great opportunity to create content, set and consult PR line, invent and test some marketing tools and combine all <br>
that with good design.
