## UX (User Experience)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create with use of `HTML` and `CSS` languages a static front-end site that will link two parties by presenting 
information demanded by customers and desired by owner.

 
### Business Goals

* Goal: Increase sales.
    * Having a website to being officialy present in the internet, well-organized content, user-friendly site, effective calls to action, over the 
      time establish good conversion rate (unsettled / unknown yet for this kind of niche market and not having this sort of data from past),
    * Motivate an audience to take next step (call, text, e-mail or submit a web inquiry). Designed pages and implemented features should serving 
      to that goal by many marketing and decision-making ways.

* Gain trust.
    * Delivering history of company confirmed in timeline on social media,
    * Assuring quality of product by providing buyers reviews,
    * Upfront display of models highlighting quality of craftsmanship,
    * Offering lifetime warranty with shipment cost covered.

* Improve communication with potential customers. 
    * Present contact details for different communication channels.
        * Highlight benefits of WhatsApp costless contact.
   
* Increase number of social media real followers.
    * stablishing easy access to owners socials channels.

* Become an growing engineer.
    * Providing information about wide range of products, 
    * Releasing teaser about research and tests of new materials to be introduced in near future, 
    * Providing open-minded approach to external, unlisted models or requested extra shaped / custom-tailored projects.


### User values
* The user has access to the gallery, gets offers, sees range of products and has possibility to ask for price or any additional <br>
questions through form or using contact details. Here highlighted WhatsApp feature informs that unwelcomed international <br>
call/text costs can be avoided, handy especially to ease contact for overseas buyers (company has a global range of consumers).
<br><br>
Visitor can recognise credibility of company, an essential verification based on insight into company social media profiles. <br>
That allows to assess owner’s timeline, check quality of followers, number of comments and likes. In times of scam websites <br>
and fake sellers it is appreciated “tool” for customer. Meanwhile it works perfectly for the owner to attract visitor to become <br>
a follower or further - earn a buyer.
<br><br>
Contact form delivers simple communication channel to ask whatever they like.
<br><br>
<br>
 

### Targeting

* Who is the focus of the goal? 
    * a biker who wants to tuning their machine in significant way by adding hand crafted exhaust,
    * a friend or close person (or group) who knows one interest and want to buy a gift / surprise,
    * motorcycle owner, enthusiast of bold design.

* Why users buy a product? 
    * to feel satisfaction while driving,
    * to be noticed by other road users,
    * to make impression in visited places by look and sound,
    * to be recognizable differnet among all riders on the same bike model, 
    * to share their proud with social media,
    * to make a gift for someone else,
    * to reach for a Bucket List item.


* What they're worried about? 
    * high prices, 
    * hidden fees, 
    * long time of product delivered, 
    * fake company (scam), 
    * unskilled welder (bungler),
    * poor materials / quality, 
    * bad look of product (aesthetics). 
    

* How to help them? 
    * clear straight prices, 
    * walk through order to delivery process
    * assurance of delivery fee included (where possible - currently Europe), 
    * gain trust by proving buyers good experience and social media reputation, pictures of products and from buyerrs feedback.


### Business values

The owner has an opportunity to display products in the Web, advertise extras, attract buy decision by highlighting offers, <br>
prove experience as successful entrepreneur for number of years and show his technical skills through pictures of products <br>
and positive feedback from actual customers and fanpage visitors.
<br><br>
Heritage and trust gained by couple of years posting on healthy accounts Facebook and Instagram with no-fake-followers <br>
has been incorporated now into webpage to build strong image of “entrepreneur you can rely”. Pictures bringing closer to <br>
product and enthusiastic comments can assure new visitors about how stable this company is.
<br><br>
There’s more behind this project – client motivated by creating process of the website ordered new line of `logo` from States, <br>
that led to creating cool picture in terms of overall marketing and public relations.

## Features

Manual

* Common elements
    * The header announce purpose of the website, mainly for positioning reasons (crucial content of Header 1), this element is hidden on smallest displays for sake of better landing page impression. Right below is main navigation that stays exactly same on all pages: Logo of company (with its initial “S” letter used for favicon) has black background and is linked to index page – same as Home button. Next buttons (“About”, “Range” and “Media”) ore getting slightly brighter shade of grey. Always one of them indicates at which page you’re at the moment. They are interactive laptop/PC screens when mouse hover over particular element – color change to a bit brother that active page button color. This reddish color is kept for all h2 section titles and makes good effect as first title on page looks like an active tab – descendant of active menu button. Yellow color of company logo is kept over all yellow accents on website.
    * The footer is repeated on all pages to make it easy to learn for the visitor to get in touch (alternative ways to Contact form) and bright social media icons (color-coded with their linked platforms) calls to check out more information on the provided Social Media networks (long timeline, positive feedback and pictures that proves quality and aesthetics, finally – increase number of true followers) and spreads advertisement widely by this days version of “Word-of-mouth”.
* The Home page <br>   
begins with a jumbotron style hero image with a motorbike background introducing what the page is about. It's a short and to the point statement as well as CTA (call to action) button allowing the visitor and a potential client to immediately enquire about the exhaust for their bike. 
<br>
Below jumbotron there is a manual on how to order and how looks all procedure steps for customer between making decision and holding product in their hands, a walk through. This section also includes a promise of no hidden costs, as well as promise of free delivery within Europe.
<br>
As we scroll down, we see an invitation to getting in touch followed by convenient form. There is also a disclaimer below, in case there are special circumstances applying to a potential customer's bike. This is followed by the footer which repeats throughout the website.

* The About page <br>
Begins with a hero image introducing the CEO and Designer in one, the owner of the company. Just below there is a short three columned introduction to the person behind SpyraMoto:

    * The Scratch <br>
is about the Family Roots and where the love for motorcycles come from and ends with internal link in blue pill button that gives a user opportunity to check whole range of products.
    * SpyraMoto describes how Wojtek started and what drives him and contains promise of Lifetime guarantee, a strong statement declaring quality and proactive company approach. 
    * The Futures touches on the attention to detail and what is in store for Future days for SpyraMoto, this sends also a message that company is bursting, keeps development and is innovation-orientated.

    As we scroll down, there is a map showing where some of past clients are coming from as well as the reviews section end up with Legal notice about copyrights and statement that owner holds documentation for these testimonials. 

* Range page <br>
    starts with triple message to encourage reader to take an action, convince him it’s deserved to beautify his bike. Right below starts the portfolio of SpyraMoto works (shorted to 6 of over 30 models just to show my concept of presentation), which essentially shows the quality of it.  Designed to have visually three different columns on tablets and bigger displays as well as keep dirrerent background for each product in responsive version on smartphones. <br>
    As a prospect customer I can immediately check out some examples of Wojtek's work, in case I am not sure what I want or if I like their look.  As range covers three main brands: Harley-Davidson, BMW and Yamaha, every model has been marked with a brand-named button that corresponds with color code of particular brand, e.g. exact shade of red used by Yamaha. <br>
    At smartphones it contains only first 3 products as a teaser with extra message encouraging user to visit more products on more comfortable displays such a tablets or computers.
        * In future this section is going to be extended by: <br>
            - clickable mini gallery of each product to show each model alone and at least one example of exhaust already fitted to bike.<br>
            - filter options to display all products for chosen 1 brand only<br>
            - functionality of social media: like / share.

* Media page<br>
    Brings the prospect client behind the scenes of exhaust production. Video brings some level of excitement about the product, the visitor to the page gets to see the man behind the company before they contact Wojtek and can appreciate a craftmanship that may bring over decision to make first step and become a buyer. <br>
    This is followed by various articles to showcase Spyramoto presence in media with date of publication - these confirms that Wojtek – the owner, is trustful player on the market and company is stable and reliable. This impression was one of the keys to assure visitor this is not a scam business nor some freshly started EU granted project that could collapse after time essential to keep donated grants. Yes, this is life.<br>

<br>
Design:
durng process of creating I discovered that actual picture of bikes send by customers are to importand to be reduced into thumbnail size that suits rather to users avatars while I wanted to expose all beauty of ready mounted product to give much stronger impression, so initial idea has been modified and Bootstrap Cards proved to be very helpful.
Motorcycle brand buttons customised to match official color coding for Yamaha Red, BMW blue and Harley Orange

Page design with rule of third , even for two-columned sections they’re 1/3 + 2/3 of the page width.
 <br>
 Lessons learned:
-	insist on Client to deliver required spreadsheet
-	special characters of business sector – inches, diameters ¾, Pounds, “>” etc…
