## Welcome to my README,
--------

<br>
<br>

Project has been created as the official website of a small but real company from metallurgy sector, that ran only social media accounts until 
now but grew up to stage where own www is a must-have for proper interactions with customers.
<br>
<br>

#VALUE

This project delivers values for both client and users. And for me, so it’s win-win-win! 
<br>
<br>

##CLIENT / OWNER

The client has opportunity to display products in the Web, advertise extras, attract by highlighting offers to making order, prove experience as 
successful entrepreneur for number of years and show his technical skills through pictures of products and positive feedback from actual 
customers and fanpage visitors.

Heritage and trust gained by couple of years posting on healthy accounts Facebook and Instagram with no-fake-followers has been incorporated now 
into webpage to build strong image of “entrepreneur you can rely”. Pictures bringing closer to product and enthusiastic comments can assure v
isitors about how stable this company is.

There’s more behind this project – client motivated by creating process of website ordered new line of logo from States, that led to creating cool 
picture in terms of marketing and public relations.
